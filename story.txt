Juggernaut: A sword master and rebel leader in his hometown. After his
rebellion was crushed, he was exiled to the mainland and started his
journey.
Setting: A world of chaos which needs one or many heroes.

Juggernaut suddenly awoke, gasping-in a daze! Where was he? He had no clue.
All he did no was there was no league, no legends. Only his favorite long
sword. And surrounding him... couscous? Why was there so much couscous?
"Must be the local fare of choice..." Juggernaut muttered. 

That's when things started getting weird. The ground started trembling, 
then shaking...  and BAM. Couscous started shooting out of a massive
geyser. Out of nowhere, another sword master exclaimed; "TURBO
COUSCOUS!" 

That swordmaster, Yunero, suddenly jumped toward Juggernaut, aiming to kill him.
Juggernaut, without any clue, parry Yunero's blade and unleashed his ultimate move
, "Omnislash". Being faster than light, Juggernaut defeated Yunero and nearly
killed him. Before Yunero passed away, Yunero said "I found you. The one who
is worthy of all the couscous I have. You shall protect all of this couscous for me". 

To be cont...
