Juggernaut: A sword master and rebel leader in his hometown. After his
rebellion was crushed, he was exiled to the mainland and started his
journey.
Setting: A world of chaos which needs one or many heroes.

Juggernaut suddenly awoke, gasping-in a daze! Where was he? He had no clue.
All he did no was there was no league, no legends. Only his favorite long
sword. And surrounding him... couscous? Why was there so much couscous?
"Must be the local fare of choice..." Juggernaut muttered. 

That's when things started getting weird. The ground started trembling, 
then shaking...  and BAM. Couscous started shooting out of a massive
geyser. Out of nowhere, another sword master exclaimed; "TURBO
COUSCOUS!" 

That swordmaster, Yunero, suddenly jumped toward Juggernaut, aiming to kill him.
Juggernaut, without any clue, parry Yunero's blade and unleashed his ultimate move
, "Omnislash". Being faster than light, Juggernaut defeated Yunero and nearly
killed him. Before Yunero passed away, Yunero said "I found you. The one who
is worthy of all the couscous I have. You shall protect all of this couscous for me". 

But why the couscous? It is the most delicious food of all and you can derive great power from it. 

Out of surprise and grief, Juggernaut buried the sword master and named his family sword as "Yunero".
With a sense of honor, he ate some couscous. Suddenly, he felt some power inside of him like never before.
His eyes became clearer; sense became sharper; and speed... fast like a turbo engieen!
Our hero Juggernaut with his legendary sword Yunero kept defeating those false heros on this land such as
TideHunter, Shadow Fiend, Blood Seeker, etc.
"That's how we live in such a peaceful world right now," said this old man infront of me,"and then, no one
saw our hero anymore. Maybe he is still practising his sword skills around the world... till the world
needs heroes again."
